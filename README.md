# COP4521-SocialReads
# The problem: 
Our website aimed to solve the problem that there are not a lot of virtual book clubs. We wanted to create a virtual book club where people can read a weekly book and communicate together by posting reviews about the book. 

# User interface instructions: 
If needed, install flask,  sqlite3, pyjokes, and flask_login with pip install flask, pip install sqlite3b, pip install pyjokes, and pip install flask_login respectively. 
Run setup.py and then app.py. This will launch the website on local host. 
The admin log in can be used each week to regenerate the books. Admin also has the ability to delete all reviews. 

# Libraries used: 
flask 
pyjokes 
sqlite3

# Other resources:  
We took free stock photos to make our website design more appealing. 
We used DB Browser for SQLite, which is a GUI, to visually see our database and make changes. 

# Extra features: 
In our original proposal, we were going to create chatrooms. We later decided to do reviews for each book instead. We also added the feature of rating the book with your review. 

# Separation of work: 
All group members equally contributed to the code and database. Between each meeting, every member was assigned a task and completed that task.
